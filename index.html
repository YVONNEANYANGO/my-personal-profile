   Programing is one of the most interesting courses one can think of doing since it
   deals mainly on technology.The more years pass by the greater the advancement
   in technology.what drove me to enrol in computer programming is the desire
   to know how to code and to know how to make quality and interesting websites
   that will offer solution to help solves problems in our various community
   and also grobally.My satisfaction will be to see that my websites have helped
